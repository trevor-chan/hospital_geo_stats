PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE BY TYPE AND SELECTED CHARACTERISTICS
Beginning in 2017, selected variable categories were updated, including age-categories, income-to-poverty ratio (IPR) categories, and the age universe for certain employment and education variables. See user note entitled <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation/user-notes.html">"Health Insurance Table Updates"</a> for further details.<br/><br/>

Logical coverage edits applying a rules-based assignment of Medicaid, Medicare and military health coverage were added as of 2009 -- please see <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2010/demo/coverage_edits_final.html">https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2010/demo/coverage_edits_final.html</a> for more details. Select geographies of 2008 data comparable to the 2009 and later tables are available at <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/acs/1-year-re-run-health-insurance.html">https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/acs/1-year-re-run-health-insurance.html</a>. The health insurance coverage category names were modified in 2010.

Although the American Community Survey (ACS) produces population, demographic and housing unit estimates, for 2020, the 2020 Census provides the official counts of the population and housing units for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns. For 2016 to 2019, the Population Estimates Program provides estimates of the population for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns and intercensal housing unit estimates for the nation, states, and counties.<br/><br/>

Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. The degree of uncertainty for an estimate arising from sampling variability is represented through the use of a margin of error. The value shown here is the 90 percent margin of error. The margin of error can be interpreted roughly as providing a 90 percent probability that the interval defined by the estimate minus the margin of error and the estimate plus the margin of error (the lower and upper confidence bounds) contains the true value. In addition to sampling variability, the ACS estimates are subject to nonsampling error (for a discussion of nonsampling variability, see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/technical-documentation.html">ACS Technical Documentation</a>). The effect of nonsampling error is not represented in these tables.<br/><br/>

Estimates of urban and rural populations, housing units, and characteristics reflect boundaries of urban areas defined based on Census 2010 data. As a result, data for urban and rural areas from the ACS do not necessarily reflect the results of ongoing urbanization.<br/><br/>

The 2016-2020 American Community Survey (ACS) data generally reflect the September 2018 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delineations of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. In certain instances, the names, codes, and boundaries of the principal cities shown in ACS tables may differ from the OMB delineation lists due to differences in the effective dates of the geographic entities.<br/><br/>
